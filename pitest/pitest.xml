--------- Original GoF Patterns ----------

Singleton Pattern
SingletonWithWorkInInitializer is a Singleton class
INSTANCE is the Singleton instance
getInstance creates and returns INSTANCE

Flyweight Pattern.
CoverageSummary is immutable.
File location: Project/pitest/pitest-entry/src/main/java/org/pitest/coverage/CoverageSummary.java

Flyweight Pattern.
SingletonWithWorkInInitializer is a flyweight factory.
INSTANCE is a flyweight object.
getInstance is the getFlyweight method.
